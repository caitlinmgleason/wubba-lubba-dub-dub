# Week 6

Unfortunately this week I had some complications in my homework process, and I have nothing to turn in from the syllabus, not without lack of trying. I am very interested in learning Javascript, so I began earlier in the week with the exercise, but as soon as I started it was apparent that there was a prerequisite for the course you suggested to us, so I had to take the “Intro to JS” course on Khan Academy, before I could take “HTML/JS: Making Interactive Webpages”, being a novice to Javascript and unfamiliar with any of the syntax. I grossly underestimated the time required to do this. In the end it took me just over ten hours to complete just the intro course. 

I hope this does not reflect poorly on my effort, as I am still dedicating many hours a week to work for this class. I still plan on finishing HTML/JS course and turning in the challenge and experiment for this week when I get a chance to catch up. I was hoping that you might be able to add some of the upcoming week’s info to the github syllabus, I and a lot of time last week that I might have been able to do this intro course had I know it would be a prerequisite. 

Hopefully my progress/activity on Khan Academy can attest to my efforts this week:

I was also hoping, if you get a chance, if you could review some not he projects I finished. I wasn’t able to figure them all out, but some I spent a good amount of time on. 

I also was able to get set up on Github over this week, I downloaded git for mac and will be uploading all my class projects there in addition to the IAM server.

Once again, I apologize for not completing this week’s work I will work diligently to catch up!
