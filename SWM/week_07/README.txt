# Week 7

This week I was able to finish the Khan Academy Program on JS for Web. Here is the link to my progress chart:

I also did the writing assignment, which we are turning in in class, but I’ll also upload it to the IAM server with a link from my index page if you would like to access it faster. 

I spent more of my practice time this week creating a javascript project, hopeful to count for what I missed last week. I will link it on my index page under “week 6.” I got the idea from Khan Academy, one of the instructors said making a pig-latin translator might be a challenging project, and I though it sounded fun, and within my scope enough to be understandable, yet still difficult. As you required I used only Javascript, it is a simple form at the moment, but you can input words and it will translate them to two different dialects of pig latin, I think this will be an ongoing project for me. I have some questions: 

-Is there a way to make a button clickable with different functions based on an if/then statement? I got mine to work, but this seems like it would be cleaner. 

-If you can figure out why my “classic” translation only outputs the last word I would be very grateful. I and it working before as you can see here:

but somewhere along the way I broke it and after about an hour and a half I gave up. I know it’s something to do with the dialect selection, when I moved var dialect = … it started working again. 

-I also put some notes in my code about things I was having trouble with. 

-Also I was wondering if you knew a quick way to clear the text box when the user enters a new input, right now it just adds to the string. 

As always, I am working on finishing old assignments and getting caught up!
