# Week 12

## Final Project

For my final I continued to practice with SVG animation. I had previously worked on a project where I attempted to animate SVG lines in a drawing fashion using someone else code (please see here: view-source:http://caitlingleason.com/spookschool/ ) the code is bulky and not necessary, but I couldn’t understand the simple version. Now that I know more Javascript I was able to more succinctly execute this method. 

I didn’t get as far as I had hoped, and plan to work more throughout this week on it. But I’m getting more used to javascript and SVG controls. 

My major question thus far: 

can you use “this” inside of a loop? I tried to make a function with a loop in it so that I could iterate the three sections of animation without repeating them, but when I replaced foo[i] with “this” it broke.
