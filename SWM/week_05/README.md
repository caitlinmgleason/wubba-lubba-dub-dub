#Week 5

```
The only question I have this week is about .md files. I understand the markdown language, but where is it read? I opened my .md files in chrome and there was no formatting. Is this only a github thing? or did I save them wrong? There wasn’t an option for .md files on textedit so I saved it with a custom extension, not sure if this works or not. If not in textedit, where else can you create and save them, must it be only on github? I have plans with a software developer friend to get a github tutorial in the upcoming week…
