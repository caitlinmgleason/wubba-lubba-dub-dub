# Week 8

## Exercise

I finished the HTML javascript course last week

## Experiment 

I did the first part pretty quick, for the second part I decided to continue to improve my Pig Latin Generator that I’ve been working on the last couple weeks. I was able to fix the bugs we were trying to get out last class (literally hours spent just to find it was a stray “}” ). I also added anther dialect, changing the translator to be Gibberish translator for various forms of word games. The new addition is “ubbi dubbi” which seems simple but I spent a long time truing to figure out a way to identify the preceding item in the array and they use an if statement on it. I’m not entirely satisfied with my solution, though it does work as it’s supposed to. I wrote a note about it in the code, if you know a more elegant solution (I was thinking a boolean function?) then that would be great. 

## Challenge

I studied!
