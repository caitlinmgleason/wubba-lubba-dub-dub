# Week Four

I’ll be real here, I didn’t spend too much time on the quick bad site, but I got it pretty bad pretty fast. I got much more into the “good” version. I don’t know if this is right, but I usually avoid using tables for anything other than actually content-filled tables, so I always see it as bad practice to style using tables, hence the use of the table grid in this atrocious example. Is not using tables a thing? It seems so 2004.

I spent a lot more time on the finished site, to be honest I got a little too absorbed, I made it responsive too. Theres still a few bugs in the responsive aspect though. I’ve been having trouble with resizing on jquery, I want certain events to fire on resize without having to refresh the page.

I do want to get into github, but this time around I didn’t have time to really dig into downloading a client etc.
